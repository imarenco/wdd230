            <h1>San Carlos de Bariloche</h1>
            <p>
                San Carlos de Bariloche, known simply as Bariloche, is a Patagonian city that, with 146,000 inhabitants
                (2022), is the most populous in the province of R√≠o Negro, and is also the head of the department of
                Bariloche.
                <br />
                <br />

                Bariloche is the most visited destination in Patagonia and one of the most visited destinations in
                Argentina. It receives around two million tourists annually, mainly in the winter season, among which
                those from European and American countries stand out due to their influx. It is known for being the main
                travel destination for high school graduates in Argentina and Uruguay.

                <br />
                <br />
                It is the most populated Argentine city in the Patagonian Andes. It is located in the Nahuel Huapi
                National Park, in the southwest of the R√≠o Negro province, next to the Andes mountain range, on the
                southern shore of Lake Nahuel Huapi, 832 km from Viedma, the capital of the province.
                <br />
                <br />

                Its natural reserves, which include lakes, forests and mountains, and its outstanding ski resorts are
                the main attraction. The city has been considered by some sources as the second ski destination in the
                world and the largest in South America. It is also in an area where you can observe and study the Andean
                condor.

                alt="tronador hill" />
            <p>Tronador is a geologically active volcano, its last eruption is unknown, although it is thought to have
                occurred more than 10,000 years ago, for which reason it would be in the process of erosion. It is
                located in the southern part of the Andes Mountains, on the border between Chile and Argentina. It
                separates two national parks: Vicente P√©rez Rosales in the province of Llanquihue, Chile, and Nahuel
                Huapi, in R√≠o Negro and Neuqu√©n, Argentina. The name of the hill is due to the noise similar to that of
                thunder produced by the frequent landslides and falls of large blocks of ice fragmented by important
                cracks in its glaciers. El Tronador has a total of 7 glaciers, some of which you will be able to see on
                this excursion. It is a full day excursion. It shows us the most beautiful areas of the Nahuel Huapi
                National Park: visiting lakes, beaches, mountains and waterfalls, being able to visualize this hill that
                is the highest in the area, 3,478 meters. From a viewpoint located at its base you can get an unbeatable
                view of the Manso River glacier. On this excursion you will be able to see the Black Snowdrift, which is
                a glacier with huge brownish blocks formed by avalanches of ice and mud; Devil's Throat, a meltwater
                waterfall surrounded by towering rock faces; among other several typical beauties of the place. We
                recommend it to be part of a unique experience, surrounded by beauties that you will keep forever in
                your memory.

                alt="arrayanes national park" />
            <p>Los Arrayanes National Park was created in 1971, covers the entire Quetrihu√© Peninsula with an area of
                ‚Äã‚Äã1,840 hectares, south of the Province of Neuqu√©n, 12 km. from Villa la Angostura, on the northern
                shore of Lake Nahuel Huapi. The name was given by its former owner, Dr. Antonio Lynch, who discovered
                the Arrayanes Forest at its end. He donated it to National Parks, except for the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe helmet
                that the heirs still keep as a symbol of the first colonizations in Patagonia.
