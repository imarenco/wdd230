            <h2>Tronador Hill</h2>
            <img data-src="./images/tronador.jpeg" />
            <p>Tronador is a geologically active volcano, its last eruption is unknown, although it is thought to have
                occurred more than 10,000 years ago, for which reason it would be in the process of erosion. It is
                located in the southern part of the Andes Mountains, on the border between Chile and Argentina. It
                separates two national parks: Vicente P√©rez Rosales in the province of Llanquihue, Chile, and Nahuel
                Huapi, in R√≠o Negro and Neuqu√©n, Argentina. The name of the hill is due to the noise similar to that of
                thunder produced by the frequent landslides and falls of large blocks of ice fragmented by important
                cracks in its glaciers. El Tronador has a total of 7 glaciers, some of which you will be able to see on
                this excursion. It is a full day excursion. It shows us the most beautiful areas of the Nahuel Huapi
                National Park: visiting lakes, beaches, mountains and waterfalls, being able to visualize this hill that
                is the highest in the area, 3,478 meters. From a viewpoint located at its base you can get an unbeatable
                view of the Manso River glacier. On this excursion you will be able to see the Black Snowdrift, which is
                a glacier with huge brownish blocks formed by avalanches of ice and mud; Devil's Throat, a meltwater
                waterfall surrounded by towering rock faces; among other several typical beauties of the place. We
                recommend it to be part of a unique experience, surrounded by beauties that you will keep forever in
                your memory.

            <h2>Arrayanes National Park</h2>
            <img data-src="./images/arrayanes.jpeg" />
            <p>Los Arrayanes National Park was created in 1971, covers the entire Quetrihu√© Peninsula with an area of
                ‚Äã‚Äã1,840 hectares, south of the Province of Neuqu√©n, 12 km. from Villa la Angostura, on the northern
                shore of Lake Nahuel Huapi. The name was given by its former owner, Dr. Antonio Lynch, who discovered
                the Arrayanes Forest at its end. He donated it to National Parks, except for the area of ‚Äã‚Äãthe helmet
                that the heirs still keep as a symbol of the first colonizations in Patagonia.
