                    This page uses horizontal and vertical alignment, in the banner at the beginning of the page you can see the button, the text and the link aligned horizontally, then you can see the texts that follow it aligned horizontally. In the last part of the view where the options 1-2/2-3 are, you can see that it is aligned vertically. Alignment is for organize different page elements, refers to how the elements are placed.

                    It is a page for the sale of body creams, first of all the way in which the page is designed invites us to see the image of a happy person using their cream, then the next thing they want us to focus on is the text and then the button to buy it. Visual Hierarchy is a principle by which we rank the elements that we want to focus on our page depending on the objective.

                    In this case, invision only offers 3 payment options, which facilitates the customer's decision and increases their conversion. It is an option where the law is fulfilled because the fewer options the profitability and sales increase because the customer has fewer options.
